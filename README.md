# React Employee Directory [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
This is progressive web application built for my fullstack coding bootcamp. This application is built off of resuable React components, utilizing different states within them to filter, sort, and change the appearance of the employee cards within the directory.

## Assignment Details & Acceptance Criteria
### Assignment Details
I was given the following user story to guide my development:

```As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.```

### Acceptance Criteria

```Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

Sort the table by at least one category

Filter the users by at least one property.

```
